## 2018 Harmful Algal Blooms
In Apr 2018, Detroit Lake experienced extremely high levels of algae, and the water contained toxins. At that time, there were no prediction available, but if there had been, our models would have provided advanced warning. Here's what our predictions would have said (a week in advance)...

# Future: 7-day Lake Forecast
Our models suggest that in the next week lake conditions will stay the same.

# Present: Lake Samples from Feb 19, 2019
Data from the lake were collected and we are seeing a normal February lake. Temperatures are low, and so is light. As a consequence there are few cyanobacteria growing.

# Past: The HAB season
It is february and historically, there have been no harmful algal blooms this month. Things will start hotting up though in March and April.
