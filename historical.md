# Learning from the past
In Apr 2018, Detroit Lake experienced numerous bloom events, and at several points the lake water contained algal toxins.

At that time, there were no prediction available, but if there had been, our models would have provided advanced warning. Here's what our predictions would have said, a week in advance of May XXX, a time when a harmful algal bloom occured:

## Future: lake forecast (2018)
The week before May XXX, 2018, our models would have suggested that in the next week algal blooms and toxin levels were going to rise:

## Past: The algal bloom season
Given the historical data, we knew that this was the HAB season, but the model predictions helped us with advanced morning of a specific event.
