# Smart Water
This initiative to predict harmful algal blooms in Detroit Lake is just the first of a multi-step process. Our machine learning models have been designed explicitly for the purpose of being able to use new data-streams. These new data will come from two main sources:

## Satellite imagery
Images of Detroit Lake taken from cameras on satellites (in space!) can be used to quantify the color of the lake water. As you can imagine, how green the water is provides an indication of whether algae are growing or not. Believe it or not, but these images can also be used to identify what kinds of algae are growing too. Data from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satelites will be at the core of this next step in our ability to predict harmful algal blooms.
