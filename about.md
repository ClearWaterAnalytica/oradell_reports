[The Prediction Lab LLC](https://www.thepredictionlab.com) (TPL) is a technical consultancy that solves hard problems with math and computer science. Our expertise lies in finding the signal in the noise: working with messy data, and using cutting edge data science tools to make predictions about the likelihood of future events.

In this project, we have worked with the City of Salem to develop new prediction algorithms for Harmful Algal Blooms in Detroit Lake, OR. We use data collected by the City of Salem from the lake, along with other weather and satellite data to predict the level of toxins and certain algae in the lake at short, medium and long-term horizons.
