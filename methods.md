A brief description of our methods. Create link to whitepaper (and ultimately the peer reviewed publication)

Issue -- big data; don't know what to do with it

Challenge -- big data is spotty and the lake is complex

Key wants: 1) predictions, 2) uncertainty, 3) informed sampling (identify key locations and variables)

Solution -- Machine Learning, what is it and how does it work

Specifically -- Bayesian Model Averaging + 1) BNNs (new and shiny) and 2) (non)linear models (i.e. state of the art...)
