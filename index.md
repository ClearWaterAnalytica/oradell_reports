introduction: |

    Our models suggest that in the next week lake conditions will most likely stay clear of harmful algae. See our most recent blog post for more information about lake water data, and where we are in the season.

## Where we are in the season
It is february and historically, there have been no harmful algal blooms this month. Things will     start hotting up though in March and April.

## Who we are and what we do
The City of Salem Public Works Technical Group and the [The Prediction Lab](https://www.thepredictionlab.com/) produce weekly forecasts of harmful algal blooms in Detroit Lake, OR. We use Big Data collected from the lake,      including water samples taken directly from the lake, as well as information on local and regional   weather. We also make use of satellite imagery, to measure changes in the color of the lake. All     this information is fed into machine learning algorithms that help us:

  - make 7 day forecasts about cyanobacteria concentrations and algal toxin levls
  - estimate levels of uncertainty about our predictions
  - learn about what drives the occurence of harmful algal blooms

See the side menu for more information about this project, and below for previous blog posts about Detroit Lake harmful algal blooms.
