## Where we are in the season
It is february and historically, there have been no harmful algal blooms this month. Things will start hotting up though in March and April.

## Detroit Lake Samples from Feb 19, 2019
Data from the lake were collected and we are seeing a normal February lake. Temperatures are low, and so is light. As a consequence there are few cyanobacteria growing.

## Detroit Lake Preditions: next week
Our models suggest that in the next week lake conditions will stay the same.
