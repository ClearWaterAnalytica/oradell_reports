## Bloom Forecast Apr 08 - Apr 15, 2022
Below are pie charts describing the probability of a cyanobacterial bloom. The one on the left describes the predictions from two weeks ago, and the one on the right describes the latest prediction, for the coming week.

## Hotspot Analysis
This map shows you the latest estimates of chlorophyll-a from the Sentinel 2a satellite. Note that the color scale is normalized to highlight the relative hotspots in the image. The colorscale does not provide an indication of the absolute amount of chlorophyll-a in the water (i.e., the map will still highlight hotspots in the winter, even if the absolute level of chlorophyll-a is low.

## Where we are in the season
Past bloom seasons have typically ended at this point in the year. As we move through to November we can expect the algae levels to decline as cooler weather arrives and sunlight diminishes.
